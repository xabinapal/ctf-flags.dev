summary: A multi-day wireless exploitation event focusing on RF reversing and signal analysis challenges.
---

SignalFest brings together teams across the globe for three days of RF-centric puzzles, ranging from SDR signal capture to firmware reversing. This edition leaned heavily on quick analysis of noisy transmissions, so tooling prep was key.

Highlights from our run include recovering the `flag{link_the_echoes}` stream in the warmup reverse challenge and a late-night sprint on a spread-spectrum decoding puzzle. Future posts will dive deeper into tooling for real-time demodulation and custom analyzers.
